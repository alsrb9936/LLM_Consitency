Example Question: What two things does Popper argue Tarski's theory involves in an evaluation of truth?  
Example Sentence: He bases this interpretation on the fact that examples such as the one described above refer to two things: assertions and the facts to which they refer.
Example Answer : { "reason" : "Who is 'He'?  The sentence doesn't say. While 'He' might be Popper in a larger context, the sentence by itself doesn't provide that information. We can't make that assumption.  What is 'this interpretation'? The sentence doesn't define what 'this interpretation' is about. It doesn't explicitly link it to Tarski's theory.", "answer" : "False"  }
